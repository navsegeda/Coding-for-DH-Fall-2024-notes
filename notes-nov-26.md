# Python Fundamentals cont'd

## Basic Structure of a Python Solution
* Create an object with two parts
  * part I: variables 
    * strings (eg original text)
    * integers (eg length of text)
    * lists (eg every individual word)
  * Part II: commands/methods that alter variables

Solutions can also include conditional statements.
* eg if statements
  * if 
   * if/else
multiple commands for multiple circumstances

## Interactive Lesson: Understanding Python

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|==|Equal to|
|!=|Not equal to|
|<|Less than|
|>|Greater than|
|<=|Less than or equal to|
|>=|Greater than or equal to|

computer translation stuff makes letters numbers -> we can use operators to look at language then

**three key boolean operators**: and, or, not

**else is the *otherwise* option**

## Python Summary

**homework:** look at [link](www.python.org/doc/) and find something interesting or confusing for us to talk about
* one thing that worked for you and one thing that didn't
  * feedback and discussion next week

# Loops with Chantal
Python Advanced Fundamentals

pseudocoding -> as a middleground/outline, integrate more humanistic version of code?
  >  translating what you want the machine to do from your language to the machine language

## Loops Defined

instruct the computer to repeat a conditional statement or a task -> asking your computer to do something over and over until a condition is meant (eg going through a text over and over to look for particular data)

true/false answers express right instruction for process -> loops executed based on this condition

### Example of simple 'for loop'

````python
For (item you would like to ITERATE over)
    perform action
````

## Practice Acitivty: flowchart task
* we kind of already did this but some of us were more effective than others (grimace corn face)
* For (shops) in potentialshops
  * if within 5 km of me and has chocolate ice cream

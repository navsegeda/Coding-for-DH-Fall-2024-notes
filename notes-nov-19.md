# Nov 19 - Module III

## Review

### Git commands

* git add - A
* git commit -m "message"
* git push

## Analog Coding
> Interpreting text according to a theme -> qualitative analysis looking for themes/pattersn -> interviews and other humanistic data

### Group Exercise

### Debrief
#### Computational Approach to Humanistic Coding

## Python and Juypter 

### Literate Programming

Knuth 1984 -> code as text, essay, literature

### Python and Literate Code

python can support 'literary' code

What is it?
>  programming langauge for writing instructions that the computer will perform
> integrates natural/human language -> makes it more accessible

### Pros and Cons of Python

**PROS/AFFORDANCES**
* readable
* easier to 'debug'
* processes data relatively quickly (vs human processing)

**CONS/CONSTRAINTS**
* higher level language (closer to natural language) so it automates certain tasks that you'd have to program yourself in another language -> so it's less memory efficient/more demanding
* lower level languages are closer to machine language so it takes less work for the computer to use it

### Using Jupyter Notebook

What is it?
* the environment we're using for our python coding

#### Python and textual analysis activity

* regex = regular expressions (library)
* **DECLARE a variable**

## Planning and Key Concepts

### Computational Mindset
* we need to change our approach to problem sovling, rethink the way we want the computer to respond to or solve a problem.
  
  * Where do we encounter our boolean operators?
    * search directory for OMNI
* Yes/No thinking -> binary language

### Yes or No Thinking
